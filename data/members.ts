  bio: "I started Dr. Interested after seeing too many youth struggle to navigate med school paths or build core skills like research and public speaking. This platform exists to change that—by giving students the tools and guidance they need to thrive. Beyond this, I have worked with Drs. Alene Toulany and Ashley Vandermorris on applying for a CIHR grant for a SickKids project to develop national guidelines on healthy youth social media use. I also supported the Future of Sport in Canada Commission by signing onto key policy recommendations aimed at making sports safer and more inclusive. I am passionate about turning ideas into impact—and helping youth lead the way. If you want to learn more about me, feel free to check out my website, which I am sure is linked somewhere",

        bio: "I’m Ishanth Shantmoorthy, a Grade 12 student at an IB school in Arizona with a strong passion for biomedical engineering and the intersection of healthcare and technology. My academic interests motivate me to explore how innovation can improve medical care and patient outcomes. To support this passion, I currently serve as Deputy Director of Finance for Dr. Interested, where I manage the club’s finances and contribute to STEM outreach initiatives. I also serve as treasurer of the National Honor Society, which has helped me develop valuable skills in budgeting and leadership.In addition to these roles, I’m co-captain of my school’s robotics team and the sub-team lead for engineering. These leadership positions allow me to guide design projects and organize technical outreach efforts, combining my interests in engineering and community engagement. I also compete in FBLA, where I placed 2nd in Coding & Programming at Regionals, ranked in the Top 10 for Accounting at States, and qualified for Nationals. Alongside these experiences, I have published two biomedical research papers and gained real-world insight by shadowing professionals in biomedical engineering. Outside of academics and leadership, I volunteer at Banner Health in both the supply chain department and the laboratory, where I assist with essential operations that support patient care. I also co-host a student-run medical podcast and have developed Money Plant, a personal finance app designed to help students build strong money management skills. My current coursework reflects my diverse interests and includes HL Biology, SL Psychology, HL History, HL Language & Literature, SL Spanish, HL Math, and Anatomy and Physiology.",
